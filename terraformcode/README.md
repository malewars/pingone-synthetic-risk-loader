This is a first draft of performing the same work with terraform and http requests.

The code is in a maintenance stage, not prime time. It can get tokens and submit requests but currently it doesn't swap the user details in each request.

Edit the credentials.json to provide your Pingone runtime information

Need to provide: client_id, client_secret, ENV ID and RiskPolicyID

Execute:
terraform init
terraform apply
```
